Given an array of size N, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(N/2) times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.


code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @return an integer
    def majorityElement(self, A):
        candidate=None
        count=0
        for num in A:
            if count==0:
                candidate=num
                count+=1
            elif num==candidate:
                count+=1
            else:
                count-=1
        return candidate
